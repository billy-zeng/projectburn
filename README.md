#SEI 7 - Project 2 - Django


Welcome to Burn!

Description:
This project is a nutrition app in which users can track their calories, fats, carbs, and protein intake. 
Unlike other nutrition apps, Burn tracks your nutritional intake via an external api called Nutronix. All you have to do is input the food you ate and when you ate it, and we handle all the rest!

user stories:
User signs up and creates login info, logs in, and is then redirected to the second signup page. There, the user inputs their macros, body metrics, and their fitness goals. the app makes calculations and does the rest!
After, the user is redirected to their dashboard where they can view (via progress bars) how close they are to their daily goal. 
The buttons on the page allow them to logout, add foods to their meals and snacks, and reset their dashboard on a new day!
